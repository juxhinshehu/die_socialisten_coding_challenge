The **injectAfter()** method is located on `ArrayMutator.php` inside the class with the same name. Unit test code
can be found on `ArrayMutatorTest.php`. 

## Exercise 1 (Javascript) 

On folder `exercise_1_javascript` is the equivalent implementation in javascript. To see the results check the console of `worker.html` file. Notice that properties order on objects is guaranteed only on **ECMAScript 6**
